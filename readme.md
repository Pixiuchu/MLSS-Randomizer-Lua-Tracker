# MLSS-Randomizer-Lua-Tracker
This is a tracker for the MLSS Randomizer through Bizhawk's Lua Console.

To use it, simply either download the latest official version or the source code, and in Bizhawk's Lua Console, click on Script -> Open Script... and open "main.lua".

Alternatively, you can just drag and drop the lua file into Bizhawk.

This works on both the Standalone version as well as the Archipelago version.
